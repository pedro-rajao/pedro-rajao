- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pedro-rajao, phD in Ecology and passionate about Data science and Programming!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science for biology and ecology.
- ðŸŒ± I am deeply committed to the intersection between academic research, technological innovation and practical application in forest conservation and restoration & data science.
         - remote sensing;
  - creator of the WhatsApp group "ProgramaÃ§Ã£o em Ecologia", where we debate and share codes in Python and R to solve problems in Ecology.
           
Currently, I work with carbon modeling and forest hydrology through remote sensing and monitoring forest conservation and restoration initiatives.
I am highly proficient in programming in R, Python (all analytical approaches) and Javascript (for application in Google Earth Engine). I master programming machine learning and deep-learning models for detecting, segmenting and classifying image elements.
